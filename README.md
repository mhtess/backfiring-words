# Backfiring words, or It goes without saying.


## Wegner et al. (1991)



Headline of candidates:
"John is affiliated with the mafia" & "Is John affiliated with the mafia?" > "John is not affiliated with the mafia." > "John is celebrating his birthday."

Slight effect of reporter reliability (Washington Post vs. National Enquirer)

Three explanations:

1. Pragmatic: Why have written this if it wasn't contentious?
2. Negation processing requires processing the affirmative (a la Clark)

## Gruenfield and Wyer (1992)

"Peter's IQ is over 100."

+ Semantics: > 100
+ Pragmatics: > 100 but just barely
+ Depends on prior

#### Replicate Wegner et al. (1999)

+ Measured how much do you believe "JFK was a good guy."
+ Said "JFK was not a bad guy."
+ Measured "JFK was a good guy."

+ "Republican countrymen are part of country clubs."

### Negations

Modeled on Wegner et al. (1991) but not necessarily political or tied to newspaper.
