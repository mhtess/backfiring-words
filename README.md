# Backfiring words, or It goes without saying.


## Wegner et al. ()1991)

Headline: "Tom is not a thief." How bad is Tom?

also, 
"Is Tom a thief?"

Three explanations:

1. Pragmatic: Why have written this if it wasn't contentious?
2. Negation processing requires processing the affirmative (a la Clark)

## Gruenfield and Wyer (1992)

"Peter's IQ is over 100."

+ Semantics: > 100
+ Pragmatics: > 100 but just barely
+ Depends on prior

#### Replicate Wegner et al. (1999)

+ Measured how much do you believe "JFK was a good guy."
+ Said "JFK was not a bad guy."
+ Measured "JFK was a good guy."

+ "Republican countrymen are part of country clubs."
