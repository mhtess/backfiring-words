\section{Introduction}

\section{Computational model}

Observing an event is often evidence for an underlying cause that could reliable give rise to the event
For example, it is reasonable to fear a wet vacation when you disembark in a new city and find it raining. 
Similarly, observing a behavior is evidence for an underlying habit in a person. 
Seeing your friend's roommate doing her dishes provides some evidence that the roommate usually does her dishes (it's a more likely explanation than the alternative). 

This raises an interesting issue for communication, however, because if an event always occurs, then----assuming the listener and speaker are in common ground about it---it is not informative to remark on it. 
It follows that a speaker who deliberately remarks ``It rained today.'' should believe that usually it doesn't rain, and believes his listener to believe this as well.
